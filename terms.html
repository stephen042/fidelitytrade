                    differ,
                    mutual claims may be offset after the Client pays the counterparty or the counterparty pays the
                    Client
                    any amount equal to the difference between their payment obligations. 15.5. If amounts payable under
                    securities buy/sell transactions, which were executed by the Company and counterparties at the
                    Client’s
                    request, and the Client’s available funds are denominated in various currencies, the Company may
                    make
                    conversion, at its discretion and in accordance with Clause 13.2. and Clause 13.3. of these

                    under
                    counterclaims differs, mutual claims may be offset after the Client delivers to the counterparty or

                    counterparty delivers to the Client the number of securities equal to the difference between their
